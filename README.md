# Meet App

The Meet app allows users to view upcoming events about various coding languages in different cities.
 
 Intended users are people who are interested in learning more coding languages in an event near them. Users are initally presented with a list of all available events, but are able to refine their search by searching for a specific city. Moreover, the cities with upcoming events and the possible topics of these events are presented in a visual graph form to make it easier for the user to understand. Users can find out more about an event they are interested in by clicking on the event to reveal more information.
